## What We Deliver

- **Application monitoring** (APM, distributed tracing)
- **Infrastructure monitoring** (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- **Log aggregation** with structured logging and search
- **Custom dashboards** tailored to your KPIs
- **Alerting & on-call** with PagerDuty or Opsgenie integration

## Why It Matters

You can't fix what you can't see. Observability gives you real-time insight into system health, user experience, and business metrics — so you can catch issues before customers do.

## Typical Engagement

- **Week 1:** Define SLIs, SLOs, and alert thresholds
- **Week 2-3:** Instrument applications and infrastructure
- **Week 4:** Build dashboards and configure alerting
- **Week 5+:** Tune alerts, reduce noise, optimize costs
