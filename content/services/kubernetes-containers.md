## What We Deliver

- **Managed Kubernetes clusters** (EKS, GKE, AKS, or self-hosted)
- **Helm charts** for application packaging and deployment
- **Auto-scaling** based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics
- **Service mesh** (Istio, Linkerd) for observability and traffic management
- **Security hardening** (RBAC, network policies, pod security standards)

## Why It Matters

Kubernetes is powerful — but complex. We set up production-grade clusters with best practices for security, cost efficiency, and developer experience.

## Typical Engagement

- **Week 1-2:** Design cluster architecture and networking
- **Week 3-4:** Deploy workloads, configure CI/CD integration
- **Week 5:** Add monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **Week 6+:** Optimize performance, train team, document runbooks
