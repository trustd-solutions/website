## What We Deliver

- **24×7 on-call coverage** via PagerDuty or Opsgenie
- **Runbook automation** for common incidents (restart service, scale capacity, etc.)
- **Incident response playbooks** for critical scenarios
- **Post-mortem reports** with root cause analysis and action items
- **SLA monitoring** and uptime reporting

## Why It Matters

Downtime is expensive — in revenue, reputation, and team morale. With 24×7 coverage, we handle the 3 AM pages so your core team can focus on building features.

## Typical Engagement

- **Week 1:** Production Readiness Review (PRR) to identify risks
- **Week 2:** Define incident tiers, escalation paths, and SLAs
- **Week 3:** Set up alerting, on-call rotations, and runbooks
- **Week 4+:** Ongoing on-call support with quarterly reviews
