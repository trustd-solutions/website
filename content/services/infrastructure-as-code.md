summary: "Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation — we codify your entire cloud so infrastructure is versioned, repeatable, and auditable."

## What We Deliver

- **Multi-cloud IaC** using Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation
- **Modular, reusable infrastructure** with CI/CD integration
- **State management** with remote backends (S3, Terraform Cloud, etc.)
- **Cost optimization** through right-sizing and reserved instances
- **Disaster recovery** with automated backups and restore scripts

## Why It Matters

Manual infrastructure is error-prone, hard to scale, and impossible to audit. Infrastructure as Code turns your cloud into a codebase — versioned in Git, peer-reviewed, and deployed automatically.

## Typical Engagement

- **Week 1-2:** Audit existing infrastructure and define IaC strategy
- **Week 3-6:** Migrate resources to code, test in staging
- **Week 7+:** Deploy to production, train team, hand off documentation
