## What We Deliver

- **End-to-end CI/CD pipelines** (build → test → deploy)
- **Automated security scans** (SAST, DAST, dependency checks)
- **Blue-green & canary deployments** for zero-downtime releases
- **Rollback automation** for fast recovery from bad deploys
- **Multi-environment workflows** (dev, staging, prod)

## Why It Matters

Shipping code manually is slow, risky, and doesn't scale. A well-designed CI/CD pipeline automates quality checks, speeds up iteration, and reduces the blast radius of bugs.

## Typical Engagement

- **Week 1:** Map current release process, identify pain points
- **Week 2-3:** Build pipeline with automated tests and deployments
- **Week 4:** Add security scans, monitoring, and alerting
- **Week 5+:** Optimize for speed, reliability, and developer experience
