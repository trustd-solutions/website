**Challenge**
Developers were deploying directly to production; monitoring was patchy; CI/CD inconsistent.

**What We Did**
- Embedded DevOps engineer full-time
- Standardized pipelines (GitHub Actions + ArgoCD)
- IaC templates (Terraform + Crossplane)
- Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- Secrets flow with AWS + 1Password

**Outcome**
- Deploy time cut to < 10 minutes
- Unified infra across dev/staging/prod with zero downtime
- ~25% AWS cost reduction
