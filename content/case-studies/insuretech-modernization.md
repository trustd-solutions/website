**Challenge**
Manual envs caused config drift and unpredictable deploys.

**What We Did**
- Audited AWS resources and networking
- Rebuilt VPCs, EKS, IAM via Terraform
- Centralized logging (Loki) + metrics (Mimir)
- Modular CI/CD for microservices

**Outcome**
- Fully reproducible envs in 6 weeks
- 0 deployment rollbacks post-migration
- Clear system health with alerting/dashboards
